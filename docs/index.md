*Screenshot only costs +1 additional credit if JavaScript rendering is already enabled.

### Credit Examples

```json
// Basic request = 1 credit
{ "url": "https://example.com" }

// JavaScript + Screenshot = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 credits
{ 
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "renderJs": true,
  "screenshot": true 
}

// Full featured request = 1 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 15 credits
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "renderJs": true,
  "serp": true,
